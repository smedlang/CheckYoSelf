# Head Smart

App aimed for users to track and improve daily mental health

1. Users log feelings and emotions each day.
2. Our app then suggests activities to do to improve upon mental health.
3. After completing the activity and submitting a reassessment, our app saves the information to suggest a more helpful activity next time.
